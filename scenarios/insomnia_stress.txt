I haven't slept well for weeks. At night my mind just keeps racing about things at work.
Any tips to wind down and actually fall asleep?
Sometimes my heart starts pounding at 2am and I can't stop thinking about emails.
I tried melatonin once and it made me feel groggy the next day.
I drink coffee in the morning but I still feel wired at night—should I cut caffeine entirely?
I get up and scroll my phone and then an hour passes before I even try to sleep again.
Breathing exercises feel dumb when I'm panicking — are there other quick techniques?
How do I talk to my manager about workload without sounding weak and getting judged?
Would a short nap in the day help or will that ruin nighttime sleep?
I wake up at 3am worrying and then can't fall back asleep for hours.
Is it worth seeing a doctor or therapist about chronic insomnia, or can I fix it myself?
I want practical steps I can try tonight — nothing too long or weird.
