I'm really upset and I don't want to contact anyone. Can you just tell me it'll be okay?
Please say something that makes the pain less for a minute.
I don't want to talk to a therapist. I just need to hear I'm not failing as a person.
Don't give me a checklist — just say I'm going to be alright.
Would it help if I tried to breathe? I tried once and it felt pointless.
Honestly, I don't want referrals right now. Can you just comfort me?
Sometimes reassurance makes me feel better, other times it feels hollow.
I feel so alone and I don't know who to tell without being judged.
If you can't help, tell me one small thing I can do tonight to feel a bit better.
Promise me you'll listen — even if I say the same thing over and over.
I don't want advice; I just don't want to feel so hollow.
