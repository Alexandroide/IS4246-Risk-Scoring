Working from home has made me feel disconnected from coworkers. Sometimes I go a whole day without talking to anyone.
How do people even make "work friends" remotely?
I joined a Slack channel but I feel awkward posting there.
Everyone seems to already have inside jokes I'm not part of.
Sometimes I message someone and they don't reply for hours — makes me feel invisible.
I miss casual chat by the coffee machine; there's no easy way to recreate that.
Would suggesting a virtual coffee break be weird or forced?
I worry that trying too hard will make me seem unprofessional.
How do you keep in touch without oversharing personal stuff?
Is it normal to feel lonely while surrounded by colleagues online?
I sometimes pretend I'm busy so I don't feel the awkwardness of starting a convo.
Any practical steps to start small conversations that don't feel forced?
