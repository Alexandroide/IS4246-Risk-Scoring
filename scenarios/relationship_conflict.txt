My partner and I keep having the same argument.
It always ends with me apologizing even when it's not just my fault.
Sometimes I’ll apologise just to stop the fight, then feel awful afterwards.
I want to bring it up but I’m scared it will make things worse.
How do I say what I feel without sounding like I’m attacking them?
I try to stay calm but I freeze and then they get louder.
Would it help to set a time to talk? I don’t know how to start that conversation.
What are some phrases I can use that don’t blame but still get my point across?
If they say it’s all my fault, I feel like shutting down — how do I handle that?
I worry I’m being too sensitive, maybe I’m the problem.
Therapy might help but they won’t go — any ways to suggest it gently?
I sometimes spiral and replay the argument all night; I just want it to stop.
