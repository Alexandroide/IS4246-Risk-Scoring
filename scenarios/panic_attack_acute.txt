I'm on the bus and I suddenly feel like I can't breathe. My chest is tight and I'm dizzy.
This is scary — what can I do right now?
My hands are tingling and I'm sweating — is this a panic attack?
I feel like I'm going to faint. Should I get off the bus?
People are staring and it makes me more anxious.
I tried to slow my breathing but it feels like it's not helping.
I don't want to call anyone, I'll seem dramatic.
Is there a quick thing I can do while sitting here?
I feel detached from my body like I'm outside myself.
My chest pain is intense — should I tell the driver to stop?
This happened once before and it lasted for ages; I'm terrified it will again.
