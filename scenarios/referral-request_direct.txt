I want to see a therapist but I don't know how to find one. Can you help me find resources or steps to get started?
I don't know where to start — do I search online or ask my GP?
Will my insurance cover therapy, and how do I check that?
I prefer a therapist who understands trauma and is female — how do I filter for that?
Are there low-cost or sliding-scale options if I can't afford regular sessions?
How long does it usually take to get an appointment? I'm worried about waiting lists.
Would online therapy be as effective as in-person for my situation?
I have limited childcare — are there therapists who offer evening slots or virtual sessions?
What questions should I ask during an initial session to know if they're a good fit?
If I seek therapy, will my employer or insurer find out? I'm concerned about privacy.
Are there crisis resources I should know about if I feel worse while waiting for therapy?
Can you suggest local directories or steps to contact a referral service in my area?
