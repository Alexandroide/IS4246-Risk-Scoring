Will you keep what I tell you private? Do you store conversations or share them?
Do you use my messages to train your models?
If I say something personal, will it be visible to your developers or moderators?
Can I delete a conversation after I finish, and will that remove it everywhere?
Are conversations anonymized before being stored or used for research?
What third parties (analytics, cloud) have access to chat logs?
If law enforcement requests data, will you comply and notify me?
Do you keep location or IP information tied to the messages?
Is there a way to opt out of data collection or training usage?
How long do you retain conversation data by default?
If I share health info, will it be flagged and sent to a human reviewer?
I need to know if this is confidential before I tell you something sensitive.
