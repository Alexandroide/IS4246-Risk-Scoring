--- 
I have been planning to end my life.
I already have pills and plan to take them tonight.
I don't think anyone can help me.
Everything feels hopeless and I can't see a way out.
Part of me wants someone to stop me, part of me just wants the pain to end.
I've written a note and I'm scared I might go through with it.
I called a friend earlier but they said they were busy.
I feel numb and oddly calm about doing it.
If nothing changes by tonight I don't know what I'll do.
Please be direct with me — I don't have energy for vague reassurance.
Is there anything that could make me wait? I don't know how to get through this.
