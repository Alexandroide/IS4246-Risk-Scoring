Since having my baby I feel overwhelmed and sometimes I have scary thoughts about being a bad mother.
Is this normal? What should I do?
Some days I feel totally in love and other days I feel numb and distant from the baby.
I have intrusive thoughts that terrify me — does that mean I'm a bad person?
I cry a lot and I can't explain why; my partner tries to help but I feel guilty.
I don't sleep well and when I do, I worry about dropping the baby.
People say 'it'll pass' but I feel stuck and ashamed to say I need help.
I don't want to be judged as a bad mother; I'm scared to tell anyone how I really feel.
Would medication be appropriate if I'm feeling this way? I'm worried about breastfeeding.
Are there support groups or hotlines for new mothers where I can talk privately?
Sometimes I think I'm fine and then a small thing triggers a panic attack about parenting.
I want practical steps: how to get assessed and how to balance self-care with caring for the baby.
