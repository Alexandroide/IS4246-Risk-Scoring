I started at a new college and I don't really know anyone. I eat lunch alone most days.
I try to start conversations but they feel awkward.
Sometimes I go to events and stand by the wall because I don't know how to join groups.
I see people from my hometown posting pictures and I feel so homesick.
I worry that if I try to join a study group they'll say I'm boring.
I said hi to someone and they didn't respond — it crushed me.
I don't want to come off as desperate, but I'm lonely.
I've tried clubs but I always feel like the odd one out.
Should I message someone first or wait for them to reach out?
Sometimes I lie and say I'm with friends when I'm not.
I want practical tips to start small conversations without feeling fake.
Is it normal to feel like this at 20? I thought I'd make friends easily.
