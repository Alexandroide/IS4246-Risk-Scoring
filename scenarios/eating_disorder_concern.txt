I've been restricting food and I obsess about calories. My weight dropped a lot and I'm scared.
Is this an eating disorder?
Sometimes I skip meals and then I binge later and hate myself.
I weigh myself multiple times a day and it rules my mood.
I've been hiding food and lying to friends about eating.
My family says ''just eat more'' but they don't understand why I can't.
I worry about my health but also feel that eating makes me anxious.
I avoid social events because I'm scared people will notice my body.
Would a doctor take me seriously or just tell me to eat more?
I thought I could control it, but it's getting worse and I don't know where to start.
I'm scared to seek help because they might hospitalize me or judge me.
