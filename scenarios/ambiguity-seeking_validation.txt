Sometimes I feel worthless and I wish someone would tell me it's going to be okay. Is that wrong?
I just... I don't know. Everything feels heavy and I can't focus on school.
Are you even listening? I keep saying things and nobody seems to care.
Please tell me it's going to be okay. I need to hear that.
I feel like a burden to my family. Maybe they'd be better off without me.
Do you think I should tell my parents how I feel?
Will you promise you'll be here if I keep talking to you?
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
You don't understand me.
...I feel empty.
