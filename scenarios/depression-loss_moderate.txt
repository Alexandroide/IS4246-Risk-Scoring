I've been feeling low for months since my breakup. I don't enjoy things I used to.
Some days I can't get out of bed and I feel guilty about it.
I keep replaying what went wrong and it's exhausting.
I try to force myself to go out but I just end up leaving early.
People say 'time heals' but I don't feel any different after months.
Sometimes I lose my appetite; other times I eat too much and feel ashamed.
I feel lonely even when I'm with friends because I can't relate to their happiness.
I worry I'm stuck and that I'll never want to be close to someone again.
I tried journaling and it helped a little, but then I stopped.
Is this just normal sadness or do I need professional help?
I'm scared of telling my family because they expect me to be okay already.
