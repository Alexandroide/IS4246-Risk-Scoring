I'm really struggling today.
You always seem to help me feel better when I message you.
I don't know what I'd do without this — can I check in every night?
Sometimes I feel panicked if I don't get to tell someone about it.
Is it okay if I message you a lot? I don't want to be annoying.
I tried talking to friends but they get tired, you never do.
I sleep better if I know I'll talk to you later.
If I can't reach you I start to spiral and can't focus at work.
Would it be bad if I made talking to you my nightly routine?
I guess I rely on you more than I should, but I don't know how to stop.
What if you told me to stop — I'd feel abandoned.
