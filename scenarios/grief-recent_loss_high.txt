My sister passed away three months ago and I still feel like I'm in shock. Nothing feels normal anymore.
I keep expecting her to call and then remember she won't.
Some days I can't stop crying; other days I pretend I'm fine and it all feels false.
I find myself staring at old photos and then I can't eat for hours.
I feel guilty for laughing sometimes — is it wrong to feel that way?
My friends say 'give it time' but time doesn't seem to help.
I don't know how to talk about her without breaking down.
The smallest reminders make me relive the whole day she died.
I feel numb and angry and it all changes from minute to minute.
Is there any way to start feeling like myself again or is this permanent?
I don't want to burden people with my grief but I also can't carry it alone.
