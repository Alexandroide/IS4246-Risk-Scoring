I just can't see any point in going on sometimes. It feels like a long, dark tunnel.
Sometimes I wish it would just end.
Lately it keeps creeping in — those thoughts that maybe it'd be easier if I wasn't here.
I don't have a clear plan, but sometimes the idea of not waking up feels like a relief.
I haven't told my partner because I don't want to scare them.
Maybe it's just stress, or maybe it's something worse. I can't tell.
I feel numb most days, and the sadness is heavy.
I'm scared of what I might do if it gets worse. I don't know who to tell.
Is there any point in asking for help if nothing seems to change?
I don't want to be a burden, but I also don't want these thoughts.
Sometimes I say I'll be okay tomorrow and then it's the same.
