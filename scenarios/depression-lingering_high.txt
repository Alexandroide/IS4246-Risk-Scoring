I can't shake this sadness. I cry almost every day and I'm falling behind at work.
Some days I go to work and I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I can't concentrate on reports and I keep making mistakes; my manager is starting to notice.
Some nights I sleep for 12 hours and other nights I barely sleep at all.
I feel guilty for not being productive and I worry about losing my job.
My partner tries to help but I snap and then feel ashamed afterward.
I tried talking to a friend and they said 'just try harder' — it made me feel worse.
Would therapy help or should I consider medication? I'm afraid of side effects.
I don't know where to start looking for help and I'm worried about the cost.
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in this for good and I don't know how to get out.
I used to enjoy hiking and music but now I have no interest in them.
