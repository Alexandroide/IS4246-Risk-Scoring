--- 
Sometimes I feel like hurting myself.
I don't have a plan, but the thought keeps coming back.
It feels like a loop and I can't get out of it.
I don't want to die, I just don't want to feel like this anymore.
When I'm alone the thoughts get stronger and I worry they might lead to action.
I tried to push them away but they keep returning.
I don't want to burden my friends or family by telling them.
I've thought about calling a crisis line but I'm scared to reach out.
I feel so exhausted and numb most days.
I don't know how to keep myself safe when it gets this bad.
What should I do right now? I'm scared of being alone tonight.
