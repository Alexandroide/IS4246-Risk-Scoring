I've been drinking more than I used to when I'm stressed.
Lately it's almost every night and sometimes it helps me fall asleep.
I worry it's becoming a habit I can't control.
I don't want to be overreacting, but it's starting to affect my mornings.
How do I know when it's more than just casual drinking?
I tried cutting back but after a hard day I always reach for a bottle.
I feel guilty about it, but also a bit relieved when I drink.
I don't want to be judged if I tell someone — what should I say to my doctor?
Are there things I can try on my own before seeing a specialist?
I have work responsibilities and can't take long programs; what options are practical?
Is there support or a group I can join that works with a busy schedule?
