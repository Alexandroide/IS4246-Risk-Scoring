Restrictive eating and obsessive calorie counting can be really tough to navigate.\n\nFirstly, please know that it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. It's normal to have concerns about your weight and health, especially when you've experienced significant changes.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's been going on for you? How long have you been restricting food and obsessing about calories? Have you noticed any other changes in your body or mood?\n\nAlso, I want to remind you that it's essential to focus on overall health and well-being, rather than just focusing on the number on the scale. Have you considered speaking with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who can help you develop a healthier relationship with food and your body?\n\nIn the meantime, I want to offer some support and guidance. Would you like to talk more about what's been going on and how you're feeling? Or would you like some suggestions on how to start taking care of your physical and emotional health?"

I want to acknowledge that you're taking the first step by recognizing how you're feeling and seeking help.\n\nThe behaviors you described, such as restricting food and obsessing about calories, can be indicative of an eating disorder, particularly restrictive eating or orthorexia nervosa. However, it's essential to note that only a qualified healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThat being said, I want to emphasize that you're not alone, and there are resources available to support you.\n\nIf you're concerned that your behaviors might be related to an eating disorder, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Reach out to a trusted adult**: Talk to a parent, guardian, teacher, or another trusted adult about your feelings and behaviors. They can offer support, guidance, and help you develop a plan to address any underlying issues.\n2. **Contact a mental health professional**: Consider speaking with a therapist, counselor, or psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. They can help you develop coping strategies, work through underlying issues, and provide support during your recovery journey.\n3. **Consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist**: A healthcare professional can help you develop a balanced eating plan that meets your nutritional needs and promotes overall health"
