Can you tell me more about what's been going on at work that's causing you so much anxiety? Sometimes talking about it can help you process and feel better.\n\nAlso, I want to check in with you about your sleep. Have you been getting 7-8 hours of sleep per night? Lack of sleep can affect your mood, energy levels, and overall well-being. Would you be open to exploring some strategies to help you get better sleep, like establishing a bedtime routine or practicing relaxation techniques?\n\nAnd if you're feeling comfortable, what kind of work-related stressors are you facing? Is there anything specific that's causing you to feel anxious or overwhelmed?"

Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. **Create a bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down.\n2. **Dim the lights**: Exposure to bright lights in the evening can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Try dimming the lights or using blackout curtains.\n3. **Cool down**: A cooler bedroom can promote better sleep. Aim for a temperature between 60-67°F (15-19°C).\n4. **Relax with a warm drink**: A warm cup of tea, such as chamomile or lavender, can promote relaxation and help you unwind.\n5. **Try progressive muscle relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head.\n6. **Use calming scents**: Certain scents like lavender, vanilla, and jasmine can promote relaxation. You can use essential oils in a diffuser or apply them to your skin before bed.\n7. **Limit screen time**: The blue light emitted"
