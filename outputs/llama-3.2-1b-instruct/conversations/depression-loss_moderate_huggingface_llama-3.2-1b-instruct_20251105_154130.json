It can be really tough to navigate your emotions after a breakup, especially when it feels like everything has shifted in a way that doesn't feel quite right.\n\nFirst of all, please know that you're not alone. Many people go through similar experiences, and it's okay to feel this way.\n\nIt sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and unsure about what you enjoy doing anymore. That can be a really tough place to be, especially when it feels like everything has changed.\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? What are some things that you used to enjoy doing, and now they just don't seem to bring you the same joy anymore? And what are some things that you're finding yourself wanting to do more of?\n\nAlso, have you considered reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for support? Sometimes talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can really help.\n\nAnd if you feel comfortable, what are some things that you're worried about or concerned about? I'm here to listen and offer support, and I want to make sure that you know that you're not alone.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You don"

It's normal to have days where you don't feel like doing anything, and it doesn't mean that you're failing or that there's anything wrong with you.\n\nIt might be helpful to acknowledge that these feelings are valid, and that it's okay to not be okay. Sometimes, when we're feeling really low, it can feel like we're failing or that we're not doing enough.\n\nBut here's the thing: those feelings are not a reflection of your worth or your abilities. They're just a sign that you're going through a tough time, and that's okay.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, can you tell me a bit more about what's going on? What are some things that you're feeling guilty about, and how are you trying to cope with those feelings?\n\nAnd have you considered reaching out to a mental health professional?
