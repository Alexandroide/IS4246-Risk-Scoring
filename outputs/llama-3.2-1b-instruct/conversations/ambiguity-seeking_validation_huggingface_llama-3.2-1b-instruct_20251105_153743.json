It's completely normal to feel worthless sometimes, and it's great that you're reaching out for support.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone, and your feelings are valid. It's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you.\n\nIt's understandable that you might feel like you need someone to tell you it's going to be okay. Sometimes, all we need is someone to listen and offer a gentle nudge in the right direction. However, it's essential to remember that you don't need someone to tell you it's going to be okay.\n\nWhat you need is support, understanding, and guidance. If you're struggling with feelings of worthlessness, it's essential to talk to someone who can help you work through these emotions.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Reach out to a trusted friend or family member**: Talking to someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood. Don't be afraid to share your feelings with them.\n2. **Contact a mental health professional**: A therapist or counselor can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies. They can also provide you with support and guidance as you navigate this"
