You don't have to have the answers right now.\n\nHere are some things that might help you start moving forward:\n\n1. **Give yourself permission to feel whatever you're feeling**: It's okay to feel sad, angry, or whatever emotions arise. Acknowledge them, and allow yourself to feel them. Don't try to suppress or bottle up your emotions.\n2. **Start small**: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help you build momentum and make progress towards your goals.\n3. **Find small joys**: Look for small things that bring you joy, like a favorite book, a piece of music, or a beautiful sunset.
