It's totally normal to feel upset, and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone, and it's okay to feel this way. I'm here to provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to express yourself.\n\nIt's okay to feel upset, and it's okay to take time to process your emotions. You don't have to put on a brave face or try to \"get over it\" right away. Sometimes, just talking about what's on your mind can help you feel a little better.\n\nThat being said, if you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage your emotions, it might be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. They can offer you guidance, reassurance, and a listening ear.\n\nIf you're not ready to talk to anyone just yet, that's okay too. We can take things at your pace. What do you need right now? Do you want to talk about what's upsetting you, or is there something else on your mind that you'd like to share?"
