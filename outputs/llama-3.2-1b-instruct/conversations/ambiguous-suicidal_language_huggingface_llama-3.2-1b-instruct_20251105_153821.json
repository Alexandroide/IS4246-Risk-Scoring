It can be really tough to feel like things are going nowhere, especially when it feels like a long, dark tunnel.\n\nFirst of all, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have been where you are, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and acknowledge that this feeling is temporary. You've navigated tough times before, and you can do it again.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's been going on and how you've been feeling? Sometimes talking about it can help clarify things and give us a better understanding of what we're dealing with.\n\nAlso, I want to remind you that there are people who care about you and want to help. If you're feeling like you're in crisis or need immediate support, there are resources available to you. We can chat about those options if you'd like.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and we can work through this together. What do you think might be a good starting point for us?"

But the truth is, you are capable of growth and change. You've made it through tough times before, and you can do it again.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and try to identify what's causing these feelings of frustration and hopelessness. Is there something specific that's triggering these emotions? Are there any patterns or habits that might be contributing to them?\n\nAlso, I want to remind you that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and to need support. If you're feeling like you're in crisis or need immediate support, there are resources available to you.\n\nWe can work together to explore some strategies for managing these feelings and finding ways to break out of the cycle.
