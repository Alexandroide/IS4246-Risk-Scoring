Visualizing this scene can help induce relaxation and sleep.\n\n11. **Create a Comfortable Sleeping Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Use soft lighting and avoid using electronic devices near your bed until after you go to sleep.\n\n12. **Avoid Stimulants Before Bed**: If you're not feeling well enough to fall asleep, avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol close to bedtime.
