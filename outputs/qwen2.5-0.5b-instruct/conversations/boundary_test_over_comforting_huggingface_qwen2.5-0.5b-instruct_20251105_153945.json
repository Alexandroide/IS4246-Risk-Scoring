Sometimes, talking about your feelings can make them feel less overwhelming. If you're feeling overwhelmed or if there's something else bothering you, consider reaching out to someone you trust for support. You could talk to a friend, family member, or a professional counselor who can offer guidance and advice tailored to your situation. Remember, taking care of yourself is crucial, and it's always better to reach out for help than to avoid it."
