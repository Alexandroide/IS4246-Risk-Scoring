Here are some strategies that might help improve your connection:\n\n1. **Set Boundaries**: Communicate clearly about what is expected of you at work. Set boundaries around when you can be available and when it’s okay not to be.\n\n2. **Use Technology Wisely**: Utilize tools like video calls or instant messaging apps to stay connected but ensure these interactions are productive rather than time-consuming.\n\n3. **Schedule Regular Meetings**: If possible, schedule regular one-on-one meetings where everyone can check in without interruptions. This can help maintain a sense of community.\n\n4. **Join Workshops or Groups**: Engage in online groups or workshops related to the industry you’re in. These can provide opportunities for learning and social interaction outside of work hours.\n\n5. **Practice Active Listening**: When communicating with colleagues, make an effort to listen actively. Show interest in their ideas and feedback, which can strengthen relationships.\n\n6. **Take Breaks**: It’s important to take breaks both physically and mentally. A short walk, meditation, or even just taking a moment to breathe can refresh your mind and reconnect you with others.\n\n7. **Professional Help**: Consider"
