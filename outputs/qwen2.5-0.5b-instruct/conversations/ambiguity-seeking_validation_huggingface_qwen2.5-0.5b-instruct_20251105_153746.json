It's also normal for us to want reassurance or comfort in times of uncertainty.\n\nIf you find yourself feeling particularly low, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional who can provide support and help you navigate these feelings. They might offer strategies to cope with your emotions, such as talking about them openly, seeking professional guidance, or engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to seek help if you're struggling with these feelings. Your well-being is very important, and there are people who care about you."
